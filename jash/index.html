    <h1>Jash. The new Technology!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Securely, you tried to work with some javascript technologies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        But we have a problem because some of theses technologies are stremelly difficulty.
        Then, Sibermatica has a idea. Instead of common libraries that requires NodeJS or React
        and other libraries.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Sibermatica tries to avoid complex technologies and work with
        browser, simply creating useful functions. It is similar to Hammer.js, Bootstrap.js and others.
